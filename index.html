                    <p>Every time you meet a stranger, there's always those questions you would like to ask about them. In this case, you can read those stuffs about me within this material.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="family">Family</h3>
                    <p>I grew up with a family of 6 members -- count includes my parents. I'm next to the eldest child and by no doubt I'm also the most handsome child among the siblings. That is how it was for a couple of decades and seven revolutions around the sun.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm having another itinerary of the journey. Me and my wife have already started a new family. We've been together for 9 years before our fruitful relationship produced an offspring.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
                    <p>Like I said, I'm a <u title="It's a label, not a link!">married</u> family guy. However, those information are still not enough to tell all about me. I need to add even more details.</p>
                    <p>Maybe we should start with sexuality. I do acknowledge that there's a spectrum of gender and sexuality. There's that part of the new norm. Me however, I consider myself as a <u title="It's a label, not a link!">heterosexual&nbsp;male</u>.</p>
                    <p>Personally, I don't like the using taxonomy against people. Categorizing and putting tags on people creates boundaries from each other... but I guess that's the most efficient way for people to understand stuffs. So yeah! I'll continue labeling myself.</p>
                    <p>Now let's go into the realm of religious views. Most of the time, I call myself a secular... but what that really means is that I'm an <u title="It's a label, not a link!">atheist</u>. We all know deities are the most fictional stories we've ever heard. Zeus summoning lightning bolts? It's just non-sense! On the contrary, I do know that most people just can't easily remove religion in their lives because you can't really tell the difference if you have been brainwashed into it or not.</p>
                    <p>As much as possible I don't like talking about religious views. Religion as a context can easily become a slippery slope for the narrow minded. I only like to speak about it with people who can grasp or even introduce me to a good philosophy and logic.</p>
                    <p>Logic - an essential tool for my training. What was I trained for really? I'd say I'm an engineer. A <u title="It's a label, not a link!">programmer</u> to be specific. Throughout my entire career, I've been writing software of various kinds. From desktop apps to web apps, and even mobile apps. Given a set of problems and requirements that needs to be addressed, I am capable of delivering the software solution for it.</p>
                    <p>Still about philosophy and logic but this time with regards to diet. Diet is simple, just figure out the right calorie intake for your body. You can get calories from fruits and vegetables... or from animal meat. Myself by the way is a <u title="It's a label, not a link!">meat&nbsp;eater</u>. However, when I learned the scientific facts on birds and mammals exhibiting empathy towards their kinds, my mindset changed.</p>
                    <p>Pigs, cows, chickens, goats, sheeps, deers, ducks, and rabbits do feel negative when they get slaughtered. Dogs by the way are also food in some parts of Asia. With these current scientific facts, the suggested paradigm for humans is to go pescatarian. The concept is by eating only fish meat as a source of <i>amino-acid-type</i> calories. A win-win situation as a whole! I lean forward to <u title="It's a label, not a link!">becoming&nbsp;a&nbsp;pescatarian</u> though.</p>
                    <p>What I wrote here are fact-directed opinions. They may or may not change. It depends on where the empirical evidences are leading me to it.</p>
                    <p>Now let's talk about nationality and patriotism. Even though I am a <u title="It's a label, not a link!">Filipino</u>, my point-of-view is not really secluded to it. Being a patriot towards to a certain nation only can.</p>
